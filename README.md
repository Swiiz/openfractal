### How to make my own Fractal?
**We use OpenGL shaders to generate the fractals.**<br />
You will be able from a configuration file to inject your own code into the shader in order to make your custom fractal. In this file you will also be able to change other options such as the colors... <br />

**Complex numbers**<br />
As you maybe know fractals such as the Mandelbrot set are generated using complex numbers.
> The Mandelbrot set is the set of values of c in the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane) for which the orbit of the [critical point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_quadratic_polynomial#Critical_point) z = 0 under [iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function) of the [quadratic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_map) remains [bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_sequence). Thus, a [complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) c is a member of the Mandelbrot set if, when starting with z‚ÇÄ = 0 and applying the iteration repeatedly, the [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value) of z‚Çô remains bounded for all n > 0. <br /><br />

To represent them inside our glsl shader, we use 2d vectors:

```GLSL
c = vec2(a, b);
```

We also provide a lot of functions for manipulating complex numbers. See 
[GLSL-Complex-Numbers](https://github.com/Quinn-With-Two-Ns/GLSL-Complex-Numbers).

### Example fractal code:  (üí• This might not work in the close future)

```GLSL
/*
MADE BY SWIIZ FOR OPEN-FRACTAL
*/

const vec4 colorPalette = -vec4(0,23,21,0); // Can be randomly generated for more fun!
const vec4 finalColor = vec4(.0); // Color applied to bounded values
const int hueModulus = 30;
            
uniform vec2 dims; // Window dimensions  | vec2(width, height)
            
out vec4 fragColor; // Output color
            
void main() {
    float zoom = 5.; // Default zoom
    int recursion = 50, // Default recursion
    i = 0;
    vec2 c = ((gl_FragCoord.xy / dims.y) - .5 - vec2(0.5*dims.x/dims.y-0.5, 0.)) * zoom, // Mapping the complex plane to the viewport
    z = c;
    for(; i <= recursion && length(z) <= 2. ; i++ ) z = cpx_pow(z, 2.) + c; // Actual iterative thing
    fragColor =  i - 1 == recursion ? finalColor : .6 + .6 * cos( 6.3 *  (float((i - 1) % hueModulus) / float(hueModulus)) + colorPalette); // Deciding the final color
}
```

### Plans
**Sharing fractals online?**<br />
We also plan to create a website where you could share your fractals, and you would have a desktop application from where you would be able to create fractals or download fractals from internet.
<br />

**3D fractals?**<br />
It is possible that we later add three dimensional fractals (or maybe even more dimensions).

**API?**<br />
We will maybe add a java api that will allow you to mess up with the software at runtime, or maybe we will add "addons".

***

### ‚úÖ Todo:
- Loading config file
- Waiting for changes on the config file
- Add zoom
- Add movement
- Clean code
- **(Not for now)** *Make the OpenFractal website and client*

***

### üèÖ Feel free to help on the project as this is pure opensource!
